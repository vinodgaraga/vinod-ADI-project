Fixing Setup Violations:
1. Load Setup-Critical Sessions
Load at least one timing session from each of the four key PVT corners:
SSm40, FFm40, SS125, FF125
Additionally, load setup-critical sessions for both functional views (func and func1), wherever there is a difference in voltage or frequency:
If the path is clocked only by 40 MHz, func is sufficient.
If the path can be clocked by either 40 MHz or 80 MHz, both func and func1 should be loaded. This ensures we capture the worst-case path, as it's unclear whether 0.9 V @ 40 MHz or 1.1 V @ 80 MHz is worse for setup.
2. Load Hold-Critical Sessions
Load at least one hold critical session from these four corners:
SSm40, FFm40, SS125, FF125
Since hold timing is not frequency-dependent and maximum voltage is the same for func and func1, loading either func or func1 is sufficient for hold analysis.
3. Load Scan Hold Views
Load a couple of scan hold timing views, typically:
SS125, FF125
Similar to hold timing, scan and scan1 are functionally equivalent for this purpose.
4. Perform VT Swaps
Swap SVU cells to SVN/SVL, and SVN cells to SVL, to improve setup timing (note that these swaps must be done only in data path and not clock path):
eco_update_cell -insts <instance_name> -cells <target_cell>
• Example:
eco_update_cell -insts u_digtop/u_dig_pinnacleplus/radio_wrap_inst/radio_top_inst/rxbb_top_inst/rx_top_inst/turbo_decoder_VMED_inst/CTI_ccl_a_buf_00335 -cells SVN_BUF_SL50_10 
For large violations, do swaps in batch mode instead of one-by-one.
An example ECO Tcl file can be referenced from:
/proj/pinnacleplus/open_shared_files/Adflow_Handoff/Drop15p2p5/from_sta_to_pnr/pinnacleplus_top/drop4_v21_e19_r_v1/eco_1513_set2.tcl 
5. Apply ECOs Across All Views
• Source and apply the ECO Tcl script in all views loaded in Steps 1–3.
• For hold timing, run:
report_timing -early -through <swapped_cell>
and ensure the path meets hold with a reasonable positive slack
6. Iterate
• Repeat VT swap (Steps 4 and 5) in a loop until:
• Setup slack is improved to ≥ -200 ps, considering ~600 ps uncertainty.
• Hold paths remain clean (no new violations introduced).
