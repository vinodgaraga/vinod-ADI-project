Fixing Hold Violations:
1. Load Hold-Critical Sessions
Load at least one timing session from each of the four key PVT corners:
SSm40, FFm40, SS125, FF125
Since hold timing is not frequency-dependent and maximum voltage is the same for func and func1, loading either func or func1 is sufficient for hold analysis.​​​
2. Load Setup-Critical Sessions
Load at least one setup critical session from these four corners:
SSm40, FFm40, SS125, FF125
Additionally, load setup-critical sessions for both functional views (func and func1), wherever there is a difference in voltage or frequency:
If the path is clocked only by 40 MHz, func is sufficient.
If the path can be clocked by either 40 MHz or 80 MHz, both func and func1 should be loaded. This ensures we capture the worst-case path, as it's unclear whether 0.9 V @ 40 MHz or 1.1 V @ 80 MHz is worse for setup.
3. Perform VT Swaps
Swap SVL cells to SVN/SVU, and SVN cells to SVU, to improve hold timing (note that these swaps must be done only in data path and not clock path):​​​​​​
eco_update_cell -insts <instance_name> -cells <target_cell>
• Example:
eco_update_cell -insts u_digtop/u_dig_pinnacleplus/radio_wrap_inst/radio_top_inst/rxbb_top_inst/rx_top_inst/turbo_decoder_VMED_inst/CTI_ccl_a_buf_00335 -cells SVU_BUF_SL50_10 
• For large violations, do swaps in batch mode instead of one-by-one.
• An example ECO Tcl file can be referenced from:
/proj/pinnacleplus/open_shared_files/Adflow_Handoff/Drop15p2p5/from_sta_to_pnr/pinnacleplus_top/drop4_v21_e20_r2_mod/revd_teco_set3_VT_Swap.tcl 
4. Apply ECOs Across All Views
Source and apply the ECO Tcl script in all views loaded in Steps 1–3.
For setup timing, run:
report_timing -through <swapped_cell>
and ensure the path meets hold with a reasonable positive slack
5. Add Buffers or DEL cells
If VT swaps do not resolve a hold violation, the next step is to consider adding buffers or DEL cells just before the Failing End Point (FEP).
Important Considerations:
Layout feasibility must be evaluated carefully during the ECO phase. Coordinate with the PnR team before making these changes.
Buffers or DEL cells should be inserted as close as possible to the FEP.
Check the fanout of the driving cell (cell before FEP) before inserting any new cells to avoid overloading the net.
• Guidelines:
• If the violation is marginal:
• Insert buffers (SVN or SVU variants).
• Re-run the same verification flow as in Step 4.
• If the violation is significant:
• Insert DEL cells (typically SVN variant).
• Re-run the same verification flow as in Step 4.
• Avoid using SVU DEL cells, as their delay variation across corners (FF to SS) is approximately 3x and can introduce instability.
• eco_add_repeater -cells <> -name { } -pins { }
• Example :
• eco_add_repeater -cells SVN_BUF_ML50_2 \ -name {FE_HOLDC2100_PLN_FE_OCPN300103_bank_wrdata_25} \ -pins {u_digtop/u_basecamp_top/u_subsys_c_top/u_sram_top/u_unit_sr_6/BANK3/PLI_FE_OCPC369979}
6. Iterate
• Repeat Steps 3, 4 and 5 in a loop until:
• Setup slack is improved to ≥ -200 ps, considering ~600 ps uncertainty.
• Hold paths remain clean (no new violations introduced).
